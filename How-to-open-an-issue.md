# How to Open an Issue

If you find a bug, weird behaviour, missing translation, a feature not working or anything strange in the application, you are encouraged to open an issue on the appropriate github page [here](https://github.com/cSploit/android/issues/new).

For your issue to be considered and solved ASAP please provide the following information while opening it:

-    Your Device model.
-    Your ROM name and version.
-    The version of cSploit your are running [if not sure, download the latest release and try to reproduce the problem with it](https://github.com/cSploit/android/releases).
-    As many details as possible on the network you are running cSploit on.
-    A *detailed* description of the issue you have:
 * if it is a MITM feature not working, please specify if the other MITM features and parts of the app are working on your network. For example:
   * App start ups ok.
    * Network hosts list appear and are clickable.
    * Select the MITM module works.
    * Select the Session hijacker module works.
    * When clicking on the "Start" button fails (write down the message!) , it says: "Cannot start process".   

-    **A logcat** (very important!) taken while the application was running and the issue happened. [learn what it is and how to use it](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1726238) -- you can also find more information [about logcat here](https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/logcat).

Any issue which will not contain those details, will be signaled with a link to this page and closed from 24h to âˆž later.
